Android News Reader Application
This is a model of android news reader application, the bottom navigation bar is used in seperating news into segments. 
An image slider is used in displaying trending news at the top of each fragment and they can be clicked to view details about them. 
The news item are listed using a recycler view.
I also used RoomDatabase to allow users bookmark news they were not chanced to read finish and go back to read them in 
the Bookmark Fragment and possibly delete them when they are done
The news item are loaded from Frirebase
